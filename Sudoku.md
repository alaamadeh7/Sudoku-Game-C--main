### What is the idea of our new game?
##### The idea of the game is a board of 9 squares overlapping 9 squares, and the player must think of three sections:
  ###### 1. Squares
  ###### 2. Rows
  ###### 3. Columns.

##### The player attempts to fill each column with nine squares, each row with nine squares, and each square with nine squares with the numbers 1 through 9.
##### Note -> “Be careful not to repeat the number in each section.”


##### The puzzle consists of several numbers in squares, and the player must find out where the rest of the numbers are.
##### The game contains several levels ranging from easy to difficult and very difficult, as well as custom and more difficult levels, and this varies according to the number of numbers and their location on the board.

###### Come on, what are you waiting for to try the game and the interesting challenges?!


# How to play Sudoku
##### 1.	First, look at the rows and columns in the grid and follow the basic rules of play.
##### 2.	Choose a number to fill the empty squares from 1-9 by choosing the correct number for each cell, keeping in mind that difficult puzzles have fewer squares and filled squares.
##### 3.	Put some marks in the empty boxes if you cannot find any solution for them for reference later in the advanced stages. At this stage, it is recommended to use a pencil to solve the problem.
##### 4.	Guess the missing number and find it using logic, as each horizontal row and vertical column in the grid contains the numbers 1-9 without repetition.
##### 5.	Check each of the rows and columns in the grid, and you can use finger tracking to be able to identify the empty cell and fill it with the correct number.
##### 6.	Inspect the large square with a bird's-eye view to fill in the missing cells and completely solve the puzzle.
